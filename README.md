### Who I am 
#### I am  Bachar Alhamada

Hello! I'm software develope and I'm currently pursuing my studies at MITT in Winnipeg, Canada. I'm a passionate programmer with a strong background in C# and JavaScript, and I'm on a mission to create exceptional web experiences.

I have a history of engaging with cutting-edge technologies and chatbots, which has given me unique insights into human-computer interactions. With every project I undertake, I'm driven by a desire to make a lasting impact and create software that makes people's lives better. So, let's connect, collaborate, and make the web a more exciting place together!
